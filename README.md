The project focuses on building **Agentic AI systems** using the `phi` framework to create autonomous agents capable of performing financial analysis and web searches. The project leverages the **Groq API** (with the LLaMA 3 70B model) and integrates tools like **YFinanceTools** for financial data and **DuckDuckGo** for web searches. The agents are designed to work independently or collaboratively to provide accurate, sourced, and well-formatted information.

#### **Key Components**:
1. **Agents**:
   - **Web Search Agent**: 
     - Role: Searches the web for information using DuckDuckGo.
     - Features: Includes sources in responses and shows tool calls for transparency.
   - **Financial Agent**:
     - Role: Provides financial data using YFinanceTools.
     - Features: Retrieves stock prices, analyst recommendations, fundamentals, and company news.
   - **Multi-AI Agent**:
     - Combines the capabilities of the web search and financial agents.
     - Instructions: Ensures data is displayed in tables and includes sources.

2. **Tools and APIs**:
   - **Groq API**: Powers the agents using the LLaMA 3 70B model for advanced reasoning and decision-making.
   - **YFinanceTools**: Fetches financial data such as stock prices, fundamentals, and news.
   - **DuckDuckGo**: Enables web searches for real-time information.

3. **Playground Interface**:
   - A user-friendly interface is created using `phi.playground` to interact with the agents.
   - The app allows users to test and visualize the agents' capabilities in real-time.

4. **Environment Setup**:
   - The project uses environment variables (via `dotenv`) to securely manage API keys for Groq and Phi.

#### **Workflow**:
1. The **Financial Agent** retrieves and analyzes financial data (e.g., stock prices, news).
2. The **Web Search Agent** supplements this with real-time information from the web.
3. The **Multi-AI Agent** combines these capabilities to provide comprehensive, sourced, and well-formatted responses.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Autonomy**: Agents operate independently or as a team to achieve their goals.
- **Transparency**: Tool calls and sources are displayed for user trust and verification.
- **User Interaction**: The Playground interface allows users to interact with the agents seamlessly.

#### **Applications**:
- Financial analysis and decision-making.
- Real-time market research and data retrieval.
- Collaborative AI systems for complex tasks.

#### **Technologies Used**:
- Python, `phi` framework, Groq API, YFinanceTools, DuckDuckGo, and `dotenv`.

### **Example Use Case**:
A user could ask the **Financial Agent** for the latest stock price of a company, and the agent would retrieve the data using YFinanceTools. If additional context is needed (e.g., recent news about the company), the **Web Search Agent** would supplement the response with information from DuckDuckGo. The **Multi-AI Agent** would then present the combined data in a structured format (e.g., tables) with proper sourcing.
